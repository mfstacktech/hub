# Cell Actions

The `Datatable` component allows you to define interactive behavior for specific cells using the `cellActions` prop (previously called `rowActions`).

This is useful when you want to make a cell clickable—for example, to navigate to a detail page, open a modal, or trigger a custom handler—based on the column it belongs to.

---

## How It Works

The `cellActions` prop is an object where:

- The keys correspond to the **column key**.
- The values are functions that receive the **row data**.
- When the user clicks on a cell in that column, the handler is triggered.

```ts
type CellActions = {
  [columnKey: string]: (row: any) => void;
};
```

---

## Example

```tsx
<Datatable
  cellActions={{
    name: (row) => {
      console.log("Name clicked", row.name);
    },
    email: (row) => {
      window.location.href = `mailto:${row.email}`;
    },
  }}
/>
```

In this example:

- Clicking the `name` cell will log the name.
- Clicking the `email` cell will open the user's default mail client.

---

## Use Cases

- Link cells to detail pages.
- Trigger modals for editing or viewing.
- Launch contextual menus or inline actions.

---

## Notes

- Only cells whose `column.key` is present in `cellActions` will be interactive.
- The click handler is attached to the **cell wrapper**.
- You can style these interactive cells using the `cell` or `actionsCell` class via `classNames`.

---

## Migration Note

If you're upgrading from an older version(`< 0.0.7`), the prop was previously called `rowActions`. Consider renaming to `cellActions` for clarity.
