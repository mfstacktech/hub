# Usage

The `Datatable` component is a powerful abstraction over [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table), designed to render data views based on backend configurations while offering flexibility for UI customization, interactions, and actions.

## Basic Example

The simplest way to use the `Datatable` is by passing a `viewId`. This ID links the component to a predefined configuration (columns, filters, etc.) typically managed on the backend.

```tsx
import { Datatable } from "@your-scope/your-datatable-package";

export default function UsersTable() {
  return <Datatable viewId="users" />;
}
```

---

## Enabling Selection

You can enable row selection by passing the `selectedItems` array and the `onSelect` callback. This allows external control over selected rows:

```tsx
const [selected, setSelected] = useState<string[]>([]);

<Datatable
  viewId="projects"
  selectedItems={selected}
  onSelect={(rows) => setSelected(rows)}
/>;
```

---

## Adding Row Actions

To add contextual actions for each row (like Edit, Delete, View), use the `rowActions` prop. This function receives the row object and returns a list of actions:

```tsx
<Datatable
  viewId="users"
  rowActions={(row) => [
    { label: "Edit", onClick: () => editUser(row.original) },
    { label: "Delete", onClick: () => deleteUser(row.original.id) },
  ]}
/>
```

Each action supports `label`, `icon`, and `onClick`.

## Styling the Table

The `classNames` prop lets you override styles for different parts of the table such as the table, headers, rows, and cells.

```tsx
<Datatable
  viewId="tasks"
  classNames={{
    table: "border-separate border-spacing-y-2",
    header: "bg-muted text-left text-sm",
    row: "hover:bg-accent transition-colors",
  }}
/>
```

This enables full control over the tableâ€™s appearance using Tailwind classes (or any CSS class system).

---

## Disable Column Resizing

If you want a simpler layout without column resizing, just set `disableResizing` to `true`:

```tsx
<Datatable viewId="events" disableResizing />
```
