# üìé Actions Column

The **Actions Column** in the `Datatable` component is a special, reserved column used to display **interactive actions (CTAs)** for each row. It is typically defined in the backend lens config and rendered as a distinct column labeled `"Actions"` or similar.

This column makes it easy to perform context-aware operations ‚Äî such as edit, view, or delete ‚Äî directly from the table interface.

---

## üîß Configuration Source

The actions column is not configured manually in the frontend. Instead, it is derived from:

- Backend lens configuration, or
- A dynamic `configCallback` function

Each row uses the backend-supplied configuration to render the relevant set of actions.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Frontend Customization with `actionsMapping`

While the structure and visibility of the actions column is controlled by the backend, the frontend can **customize** or **enhance** each action‚Äôs behavior or appearance via the `actionsMapping` prop.

This prop allows you to:

- Override the `icon`, `url`, or `label`
- Add `confirmation` prompts
- Provide a custom `callback` instead of navigation
- Replace rendering with a custom `component`
- Apply custom styles

> üîÅ **Precedence Rule:** Values from the backend configuration take precedence over anything passed via `actionsMapping`.

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Customizing Actions

```tsx
<Datatable
  actionsMapping={{
    view: {
      icon: EyeIcon,
      url: "/view/:id",
    },
    delete: {
      icon: Trash2,
      confirmation: true,
      callback: ({ url, data }) => {
        console.log("Deleted:", data);
      },
    },
    custom: {
      icon: Clock,
      label: "Schedule",
      url: "/schedule/:id",
      callback: ({ url }) => {
        // Optional side effect
      },
    },
  }}
/>
```

In this example:

- The `view` action uses a custom icon and route.
- The `delete` action includes a confirmation step and a callback function.
- A new action (`custom`) is enhanced with both a label and icon.

---

## üßµ Nested Actions

Action items can include an `options` array for rendering nested dropdown actions. These are configured via the backend but can inherit behavior or styling from the mapping.

---

## ü™Ñ Dynamic URLs

Both backend configs and `actionsMapping` can use `:placeholders` in URLs, which are automatically interpolated using row data:

```
/edit/:id
/view/:city.locality.id
```
