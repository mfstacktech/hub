# Context

The `Datatable` component is powered by an internal context system that encapsulates state management for core table functionality—such as column visibility, selected rows, drag-and-drop ordering, view metadata, and data source configuration.

At the heart of this system is the `DataTableLensContextProvider`, which wraps your table and injects configuration from the Lens view engine, as well as `DatatableContextProvider`, which handles table-level logic like column states and selections.

---

## DataTableLensContextProvider

This is the high-level provider that connects your `Datatable` to:

- Lens-powered backend view configuration
- Filters and search state
- Column definitions, permissions, and identifier keys
- Row action validation
- DnD sensors
- Context-based view data like modals, scopes, etc.

It fetches view-specific configuration and initializes the core context once the backend has responded.

```tsx
<DataTableLensContextProvider
  selectedItems={selected}
  onSelect={setSelected}
  classNames={...}
  viewId="user_view"
  rowActions={...}
>
  <DatatableList />
</DataTableLensContextProvider>
```

> This is automatically handled by the `Datatable` component, so you typically don’t need to use this directly.

## DatatableContextProvider

This internal provider sets up local state and configurations using values from Lens, including:

- Selection state
- Column pinning, order, and visibility
- Column resizing
- Drag-and-drop setup
- Row identifiers
- Class names and styling config

It exposes these values via `DatatableContext`.

## Using `useDataTableContext`

To interact with internal table state (for example, selection or filters), use the context hook:

```tsx
import { useDataTableContext } from "@/path-to-context";

const { selectedRows, setSelectedRows, filters, searchQuery } = useDataTableContext();
```

Common values available:

| Property            | Description                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `selectedRows`      | Currently selected rows                            |
| `setSelectedRows`   | Method to update selection                         |
| `columnVisibility`  | Map of visible columns                             |
| `setColumnVisibility` | Set column visibility                             |
| `columnOrder`       | Array of column IDs determining their order        |
| `adjustedColumns`   | Columns adjusted after resize                      |
| `filters`           | Active filter conditions                           |
| `searchQuery`       | Search term being applied                          |
| `viewId`            | View identifier used for backend queries           |
| `identifierKey`     | Unique key used to identify each row               |
| `classNames`        | Custom styling applied through props               |

## Custom Use Case Example

You can use the context to build custom controls around the table:

```tsx
const TableToolbar = () => {
  const { searchQuery, filters, setSelectedRows } = useDataTableContext();

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <span className="text-muted-foreground">Search: {searchQuery}</span>
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedRows([])}>Clear Selection</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
