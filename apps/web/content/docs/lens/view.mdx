# üëÅÔ∏è View

The `View` component is a context provider used inside the `LensProvider` to manage **view-specific configuration**, state, and layout behavior.

It acts as a boundary for each *lens view* and is responsible for handling state like filters, search queries, modals/sheets, and view identifiers. All components like `Datatable`, `SimpleFilters`, and custom Lens-compatible widgets rely on the `View` context to function properly.

---

## üì¶ Import

```tsx
import { View } from "@locospec/lens-react";
```

---

## üß† Why `View` is Needed

`View` provides:

- A **scoped context** for a single lens configuration, especially useful when rendering multiple views in the same app.
- Access to **view-level configuration** fetched by `LensProvider` (based on a `viewId`).
- State for filters, search query, and sheet/modal visibility.
- A reference to the container (`ref`) for sheet positioning and dynamic layout changes.
- An ID (`view_uuid`) to uniquely track view instance, useful for analytics or debugging.

## üß© Props

| Prop              | Type                     | Description |
|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| `viewId`          | `string` (default: `"default"`) | The key to access the correct config object from the global Lens config. |
| `children`        | `React.ReactNode`        | Components to render inside the view. |
| `viewConfiguration` | `Record<string, any>` | Additional view-level context, if needed (e.g., dynamic tokens, UI options). |
| `showSheetProp`   | `boolean`                | Controls visibility of the Lens Sheet (sidebar modal). |
| `setShowSheetProp`| `(val: boolean) => void` | Optional external control to manage the Sheet toggle. |

---

## üß™ Example

```tsx
<View viewId="orders-view">
  <SimpleFilters />
  <SearchInput />
  <Datatable />
</View>
```

This will:

- Load config from the `orders-view` key inside the global Lens config.
- Provide filter and search state to all child components.
- Automatically render a sheet modal (`LensSidebar`) controlled by internal or external state.

## üîÑ Internally Provides (via ViewContext)

You can access the following via `useContext(ViewContext)`:

| Key              | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `filters`        | Current filter object (used in API calls). |
| `searchQuery`    | Current search string. |
| `setFilters`     | Method to update filters. |
| `search`         | Method to update search query. |
| `viewId`         | The unique ID of this view. |
| `view_uuid`      | A random ID used internally for uniqueness. |
| `viewChildRef`   | A ref to the main container div. |
| `config`         | The Lens config for this view. |
| `showSheet`      | Whether the Lens Sheet is open. |
| `setShowSheet`   | Method to toggle the sheet modal. |
| `context`        | Any extra user-passed context (like filters, user IDs, etc). |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

- The `View` **must be used inside** a `LensProvider`, otherwise it will throw an error.
- The `viewId` should match a key inside the config returned by the Lens API or `configCallback`.
