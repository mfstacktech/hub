### Introduction

Welcome to the Locospec/Lens documentation!

### What is @locospec/lens-react?

`@locospec/lens-react` is a headless and styled data visualization framework for React, designed to help developers build powerful data exploration interfaces with ease. It provides a consistent and extensible structure for rendering, filtering, viewing, and interacting with datasets â€” all customizable and built to fit into any design system.

Think of it as a lens that lets users focus on the exact slice of data they need â€” whether thatâ€™s through a datatable, a raw data view, filters, or custom-built views.

### Use Cases & Philosophy

The core philosophy behind lens-react is modularity and clarity in data presentation. It aims to simplify the development of data-heavy UIs by offering:

- **Composable components** for filtering, searching, and rendering data
- **Configurable views** like tables, cards, and raw data modes
- **Customizable filtering logic**, from simple toggles to full-blown filter builders
- **Themable and pluggable architecture** to work seamlessly in any design system
- Typical use-cases include:
  - Admin panels & dashboards
  - Internal tools
  - Data review & auditing tools
  - CMS-like interfaces

---

### Compatibility

- **React**: `18.x` and above
- **Bundlers**: Compatible with Vite, Webpack, Next.js, etc.
- **Browser Support**: Modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (default theme), but customizable via tokens or class overrides

### Quick Preview

```tsx
import { LensProvider, DataTable } from "@locospec/lens-react";

function App() {
  return (
    <LensProvider lensConfiguration={lensConfiguration}>
      <View viewConfiguration={viewConfiguration}>
        <DataTable
          selectedItems={checkedIds}
          onSelect={handleSelectionChange}
          variant="vanilla"
        />
      </View>
    </LensProvider>
  );
}
```

> You can start with just a `LensProvider` and `DataTable` to see your data come to life.
