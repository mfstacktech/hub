# ðŸ§¼ Simple Filters

The `SimpleFilters` component provides a minimal, plug-and-play way to create dropdown or date filters powered by your Lens view config. It supports filtering fields based on enums, relationships, or date values and can express hierarchical filters using dependency chains.

---

## âœ¨ Overview

At its core, `SimpleFilters` reads from a special config object (typically called `lensSimpleFilters`) and renders interactive filter elements. These filters are most useful for quick filtering of data in views such as tables, cards, or dashboards.

---

## ðŸ§± Configuration Object

The filters are defined in the `lensSimpleFilters` config within a view:

```ts
lensSimpleFilters: {
  "state.name": {
    type: "enum",
    label: "States",
    model: "state",
  },
  "district.name": {
    type: "enum",
    label: "District",
    model: "district",
    dependsOn: ["state.name"],
  },
  "category": {
    type: "enum",
    label: "Category",
    model: "category",
    options: [
      { title: "One", const: "One" },
      { title: "Two", const: "Two" },
    ],
  },
}
```

---

## ðŸ§  Internals and Context Behavior

`SimpleFilters` relies on a `SimpleFilterContextProvider`, which connects to two key providers:

- `LensContext`: Provides access to APIs and global config like `read_relation_option`.
- `ViewContext`: Provides the `filters`, `setFilters`, and `config` for the current view.

### ðŸ”„ Initialization Flow

1. It **reads the config** from the current view (`ViewContext.config.filters`)
2. Filters marked with `asSimple: true` are selected
3. These filters are converted into an `attributesArray`
4. Default filter values are initialized via the `initilizeFilter` utility
5. The `SimpleFiltersContext` exposes methods to update conditions and apply filters

### ðŸ“¦ Provided Context Values

The `SimpleFiltersContext` shares the following via React context:

| Key               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `attributesArray` | List of simple filters to render                                            |
| `initialisedFilter` | Either provided `defaultFiltersValue` or generated from the config        |
| `filterContainerRef` | Ref used for scrolling/styling                                            |
| `setFilters`      | View-level function to apply updated filters                                |
| `updateCondition` | Function to update a specific filter condition                              |
| `filter`          | Flattened version of active filters (excluding nested conditions)           |
| `queryEndpoint`   | API endpoint used to load enum filter options dynamically                   |
| `permissionHeaders` | Any extra headers needed for backend permission enforcement               |
| `classNames`      | Optional class overrides for styling the wrapper and filters                |

## ðŸ§© Component Usage

```tsx
<SimpleFilters
  defaultFiltersValue={{
    "state.name": "Uttar Pradesh",
    "district.name": "Lucknow"
  }}
  viewId="asset-summary"
  asChip
/>
```

---

## ðŸ§  Best Practices

- Use `dependsOn` in your filter config to enforce selection order (state â†’ district â†’ city).
- Provide static `options` only for standalone filters; prefer `model` when dynamic loading is needed.
- Wrap `SimpleFilters` inside views powered by `LensProvider` and `ViewContext`.
